The goal is to create an application which helps the user to maintain his/her debit card and also track spending limits. The app would have a debit card page and a spending limit page. The debit card page has the debit card details along with the available balance in the account and also lists out the actions the user can perform regarding the card and account linked with the card such as top-up, freeze card, request a new card and also the list of deactivated cards. The app also has an explicit page for viewing and tracking the limit for the corresponding week and also has the access to change the money to be spent limit.
